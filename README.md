### Theory
A quick and simplified answer is that Lorem Ipsum refers to text that the DTP (Desktop Publishing) industry use as replacement text when the real text is not available. ... Lorem Ipsum is dummy text which has no meaning however looks very similar to real text.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

Here, we are going through a matrix of order n times r, where
	n = number of elements in array
r = OR of all elements in array 

Hence time complexity comes out to be O(nr)

**Space Complexity**
And for space complexity, since we are making a matrix of order n times r,
Space complexity is O(nr)
